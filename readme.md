## Prime Photo Frame (web)
This is my web version of the prime photo frame that I attempted to build with an android build environment.

It's super basic, a website that shows the time.  The background images rotate based on what the server directory has.  However you load these images is up to you, I'm going to have a copy of photos from Prime Photos.
